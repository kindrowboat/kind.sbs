    <h1>kind.sbs - mental weather alert service</h1>
    <p>Hi! I&#39;m Stef (aka co-op &amp; kindrobot). I have Bipolar II Disorder and Generalised Anxiety Disorder.
When I&#39;m experiencing a mental health episode, I often find it hard to communicate what&#39;s going on
with my friends and co-workers, so I made this site to make it easier. You are not required to do
anything. I take my mental health seriously and will seek professional help when needed. The greatest
gift you can give me is your understanding and patience. Thank you for being a part of my life ðŸ’ž
</p>
    <h2>Elevated Depression ðŸ˜žðŸŸ </h2>
    <p>I am experiencing elevated depression symptoms. I may be feeling sad, hopeless, or numb. I may be
