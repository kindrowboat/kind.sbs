title: kind.sbs - mental weather alert service
description: |
  Hi! I'm Stef (aka co-op & kindrobot). I have Bipolar II Disorder and
  Generalised Anxiety Disorder.  When I'm experiencing a mental health episode,
  I often find it hard to communicate what's going on with my friends and
  co-workers, so I made this site to make it easier. You (a friend, loved one,
  etc) might send me a friendly text, as you do. But, because I'm going through
  tough mental weather, I don't have the spoons to craft a proper response. I
  can at least get you a short signal (e.g. [kind.sbs/ðŸ˜°ðŸŸ ](https://kind.sbs/ðŸ˜°ðŸŸ )),
  and then you know.  You are not required to do anything. I take my mental
  health seriously and will seek professional help when needed. The greatest
  gift you can give me is your understanding and patience. Thank you for being a
  part of my life ðŸ’ž
