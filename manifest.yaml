  Hi! I'm Stef (aka co-op & kindrobot). I have Bipolar II Disorder and Generalised Anxiety Disorder.
  When I'm experiencing a mental health episode, I often find it hard to communicate what's going on
  with my friends and co-workers, so I made this site to make it easier. You are not required to do
  anything. I take my mental health seriously and will seek professional help when needed. The greatest
  gift you can give me is your understanding and patience. Thank you for being a part of my life ðŸ’ž
